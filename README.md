This page includes a Facebook login method at the top (not yet defined, not functioning), followed by the option for users to log in with their email and password. Security controls have been implemented to allow password visibility toggling. Clicking on the "Forgot Password" section triggers the sending of a password reset link to the user's email. When the user clicks on "Sign Up," they can enter the required information to create a new user account. If a user has previously logged in, they can directly transition to the main page without entering the login screen.

On the main page, a design similar to Instagram has been implemented, and user posts are displayed within a RecyclerView. Each post includes the user's profile photo, post photo, username, and caption. Other views are currently not functionally defined, such as messaging, liking, and saving.


------------------------------------------- Upload Page -----------------------------------------------------

On the post uploading screen, the user selects a photo from the gallery, adds a caption, and then uploads it.


------------------------------------------- Profile Page -----------------------------------------------------

On the profile page, the user's name, username, the number of uploaded posts, profile photo, and posts are visible. Users can tap on their profile photo to upload a new one from the gallery, and each user has a default profile photo to eliminate null values. Additionally, from the menu on the right, users can verify their email, change their password and log in again, or log out of their account.
